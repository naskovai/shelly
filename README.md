## How It Works

Shelly uses AI to interpret plain English and translate it into accurate terminal commands.

## Usage Examples

shelly 'git history'
shelly 'check size of files in this directory but format it with gb/mb, etc'
shelly 'find "class" in files in this directory without the .venv dir'
```

## Installation

brew tap paletov/shelly https://github.com/paletov/shelly
